## Version
ICanCook 1.0

## Description 

This website was created to execute simple functions like to show you how to cook according to your kitchen inventory thus 
making life simple to cook anything with enhanced descriptive recipies..


## Features 
Through heavy coding and analysis we came up with a enhanced way of discovering recipies via;
-the user chooses the ingredients they have in their disposal
-the website processes how their combination would fit their needs
-A link to the suggested website is displayed via an alert and once the user clicks on the link they are redirected to the site.
